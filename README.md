ðŸ§  Fashion MNIST CNN Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify grayscale images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 labeled images across 10 categories such as T-shirt/top, Trouser, Dress, and Sneaker. The model architecture features two convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers to perform image classification. It is trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 64 and evaluated using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix. Input images are normalized and reshaped prior to training, and the model uses the Adam optimizer with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. This project provides a straightforward example of applying deep learning to a real-world computer vision problem, making it ideal for educational and prototyping purposes.
